<!--
    Awesome, your propel set up is nearly done! You just have to describe how you want your database to look like.

    You can let propel set up your sqlite database by running `vendor/bin/propel database:create && vendor/bin/propel database:insert-sql`.
    This will create your database including all the tables.
-->

<!--
    The root tag of the XML schema is the <database> tag.

    The `name` attribute defines the name of the connection that Propel uses for the tables in this schema. It is not
    necessarily the name of the actual database. In fact, Propel uses some configuration properties to link a connection
    name with real connection settings (like database name, user and password).

    The `defaultIdMethod` attribute indicates that the tables in this schema use the database's "native"
    auto-increment/sequence features to handle id columns that are set to auto-increment.

   [TIP]: You can define several schemas for a single project. Just make sure that each of the schema
          filenames end with schema.xml.

<database name="default" defaultIdMethod="native"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

    <table name="user" phpName="User">
        <column name="username" type="varchar" size="255" required="true"/>
        <column name="password" type="varchar" size="255" required="true" />
    </table>

        When you're done with editing, open a terminal and run
            `$ cd /home/thomas/Workspace/Securimag/gh-challs19/orm_login/src`
            `$ vendor/bin/propel build`
        to generate the model classes.

        You should now be able to perform basic crud operations with your models. To learn how to use these models
        please look into our documentation: http://propelorm.org/documentation/03-basic-crud.html
