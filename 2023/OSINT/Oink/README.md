# Oink!

## Description

With my friend, we love this cute emoji. And recently, she asked me to find who was behind it, and I am struggling to find the publisher.

I am asking for the full name of the person who first published it, when did they start working on digital typography and in what establishment they were in at that time?

Flag format (all lowercase, spaces replaced with `-`): `GH{name_surname_year_establishment-name}`

Eg: `GH{thomas_vincent_2019_iut2-grenoble}`

    Either by searching the "pig" emoji on emojipedia, or reverse search the image, we can find out it comes from Google Noto Color Emoji, on old versions of Android (between 2013 and 2016)

    On [GitHub](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/), we can find the emoji font. With a quick look to the history of the repo, we can find that Roozbeh Pournader is the author of the first commit publishing the pig emoji.

    A quick search on google of his name gives away two interesting websites: [Twitter (now unfortunately X)](https://twitter.com/roozbehp/media) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roozbeh/). The first one gives a link to his bio on [The Unicode Blog](http://blog.unicode.org/2020/01/new-unicode-technical-director.html), which states that he started working on i11n, standardization, OSS and digital typography in 1994. The second one tells us that he was in **Allameh Helli High School** at that time.
