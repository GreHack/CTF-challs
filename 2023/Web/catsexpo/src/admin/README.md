# Notes

Hi, not sure actually about how to configure Vhost in Nginx to host the admin application internally, so I host it on the main website at the URI : 
- /database-management-construction-30842a721b2b56df29aaf6561ead9df2/

There is no security problem because nobody can guess this folder and this README file is not exposed in web root!

Regards
